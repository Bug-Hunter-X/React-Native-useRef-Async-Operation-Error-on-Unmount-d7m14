This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the effect using `useRef` completes its asynchronous operation.  The asynchronous operation might try to update the ref's value after the component has been unmounted, resulting in the error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')`.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('some_url');
      const data = await response.json();
      // This will throw an error if the component unmounts before the fetch completes
      myRef.current.setState({ data }); 
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
